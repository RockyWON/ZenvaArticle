      <h2>UFC 220 WAS MIROCIC'S PLAYGROUND</h2>
      <h5>SPORTS, JAN. 21, 2018</h5>
      <img src="mirocic.jpg"></img>
      <p>Mirocic and Ngannou both shared their fair share of success going into UFC220.One stat that shows that is the fact that both had stoppage victories, at least going into the night.Mirocic victories stood out, having 3 of 5 of his knockouts which were displayed in the title fight.Some say this experience may have lead to the final result as mirocic made short work of Ngannou, finishing the contest in just five rounds.Another key reason that may have lead to Mirocic victory was the obvious early momentum shift by Mirocic.Some say this change was caused by the underestimation of Mirocic by Ngannou.The strategies of both men were clearly different as you could see early.Ngannou was very aggressive while Mirocic was very passive which lead to Mirocic success.Mirocic didn't even go for a takedown at
 first.Mirrocic waited and paced himself until he knew Ngannou was tired and then picked his moment.His strategy worked and that what decided the fight.One can only imagine how far this victory will take Mirocic.

      <h2>The Tech industry is changing its stripes</h2>

      <img src="technology.jpg"></img>
      <p>The tech industry has always been a booming since the internet, but the industry seems to be changing right before everyone’s eyes.Zapier is the company pulling strings leaving everyone by surprise.Zapier turned heads when they were encouraging employees and “potential” employees to the de-locate outside of San Fransisco.The way this possible contract has constructed the money and employee would make would go further if an employee lived outside of San Fransisco.The trend for an ideal San Fransisco apartment would be 3,000 dollars, which as you could imagine would leave a big whole in someone wallet.You could find an inexpensive house elsewhere that would trump whatever you could find in the San Fransisco.Facebook and Google have both encouraged workers to work closer to their respective headquarters.A study by indeed.com suggested that 35 percent of job seekers with the Bay is for opportunities outside of it.</p>
